    description: "The Volkswagen Transporter T5 launched on October 6, 2002, with full production beginning April 25, 2003, replacing the T4. This fifth generation marked a significant evolution with front-mounted engines and more car-like handling while maintaining the versatility of a commercial vehicle. Available in over 100 configurations including panel van, kombi, caravelle, multivan, and the California campervan. Engine options included 2.0L and 3.2L VR6 petrol engines, 1.9L TDI, and 2.5L TDI diesel engines with power outputs from 85 to 235 horsepower. Transmission options included 5-speed and 6-speed manual, and 6-speed automatic, with front-wheel drive or 4MOTION all-wheel drive. The pre-facelift model featured a distinctive front grille design and was marketed across Europe, Asia, and Latin America but not in the US due to the 'chicken tax' tariff."

    description: "The facelifted T5 launched in late 2009/2010 featuring significant visual and technical updates. Exterior changes included a revised front grille, updated headlights with optional Bi-Xenon units with LED daytime running lights, and refreshed bumper designs. The major technical advancement was the introduction of a world-first 7-speed Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) for light commercial vehicles. All engines were replaced with new 2.0L inline-four-cylinder designs featuring common rail fuel injection, replacing the previous Pumpe Düse unit injector system. New safety and technology features included Side Lane Assist blind spot monitoring, tyre pressure monitoring, touchscreen Radio Navigation System (RNS), and a reversing camera. The facelifted T5 continued to be available in all variants including the California campervan, maintaining its reputation for quality, durability, and versatility until being replaced by the T6 in 2015."
